# Why I Love Jekyll

Jekyll is a fantastic static site generator, and here's why I love using it:

1. **Simplicity**: Jekyll is straightforward to set up and use.
2. **Flexibility**: It allows for easy customization and theming.
3. **Markdown Support**: Writing content in Markdown is a breeze.
4. **Free Hosting**: With GitHub Pages, hosting is free and easy.
