<h1 class="page-title">Introducing the Open Redistricting Network</h1>

In the wake of the 2010 redistricting cycle, we witnessed the corrosive effects of partisan gerrymandering, in both the broad, aggressive Republican-led REDMAP project to reshape Congress as well as one-off attempts by Democratic-controlled state legislatures to skew their congressional delegations, like in Maryland. On top of that, the Supreme Court’s ruling in Rucho v. Common Cause (2019) that claims of partisan gerrymandering are nonjusticiable gave states a shield behind which they could defend racial gerrymanders as “just partisan gerrymanders." These calculated efforts resulted in disproportional representation and weakened a pillar of our (little ‘d’) democratic process.

But over the ensuing decade, the emergence of "open redistricting" marked a turning point in the fight for fair representation. This grassroots movement—fueled by technology, data, a few passionate & well-placed volunteers, and newly empowered advocacy groups and scores of engaged citizens—demonstrated the transformative potential of transparency and public engagement in the redistricting process.

Our movement is not about advancing any particular political agenda, but rather about ensuring that citizens’ voices are heard and they are fairly represented. We are dedicated to keeping the redistricting process out of backrooms and out in the open for all to see.
