Our mission is to ensure that the open redistricting ecosystem as a whole 
not only survives but thrives through 2032 and beyond &ndash; that the essential
tools, data, and resources for effective participation in the redistricting process
are free and available to all who need them.

The Open Redistricting Network was founded in October 2024, by [Alec Ramsay](https://t.co/uAamRaXan7),
in consultation with several prominent members of the open redistricting community.
He serves as the Executive Director.
Alec built the analytics engine for [Dave's Redistricting](https://davesredistricting.org) (DRA), and 
he remains active in the project,
but this is an independent initiative.
